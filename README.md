Logger
======

A logger based on log4net with some personal flavor

This is an extension of mine, based on log4net. It has the ability to use multi-threaded logging and other various enhancements. The aim is to expand this logger to do all that log4net has to offer and add the ability to expand regular expression set for formatting log files and so on.
